        ðŸš€All right guys. We are going to launch on 9mm paired with pulse (PLS). Contract address will be published here in the chat 1-2 mins before launch (actual LP creation). 
        PLS or WPLS? Seems not everyone understand mechanics under this two entities. Short answer is: you should pick PLS on 9mm's frontend. 
        Also one more thing we didn't mention a lot (but you probably noticed in our roadmap), we are going launch coins staking. Anyways current main priority is an initial launch.ðŸš€


        ðŸš¨Regarding stuck transactions some of you could have with another 404 tokens. 

        Short version:
        Just don't buy A LOT of tokens at one time. Try to do less than 100 per one transaction and you'll be fine.

        Longer version:
        Every time you transfer token (including buy\see on dex) it mints\burns NFTs (as a key mechanism of ERC404). It takes gas. Metamask along with some other tokens are not professional gas estimators (especially when we are talking about new technology which ERC\PRC404 is). I didn't dig deep into it, so don't know if it even sends it to blockchain, in that case you should get response from RPC or TX should be reverted. Anyways, just follow the "short version" to avoid issues. Wanna buy a lot? Better buy in few TXs than sit with a stuck one without a way to cancel it.
